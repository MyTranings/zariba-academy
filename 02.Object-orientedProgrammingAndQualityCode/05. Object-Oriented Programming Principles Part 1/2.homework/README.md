1. We are given a school. In the school there are classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. 
	Each teacher  teaches a set of disciplines. Students have a name and a unique class number. 
	Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have a name. Disciplines have a name, number of lectures and 
	number of exercises. Both teachers and students are people. Students, classes, teachers and disciplines could 
	have optional comments (free text block). Your task is to identify the OOP classes, their attributes and 
	operations, encapsulate their fields , define the class hierarchy and create a class diagram.
2. Define an abstract class Human with a first name and last name. Define a new class Student which is 
	derived from Human and a has a new field – grade. Define class worker derived from Human with a new property 
	WeekSalary and WorkHoursPerDay and a method MoneyPerHour() which returns the money earned per hour. 
	Define the constructors and properties for this hierarchy. Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by 
	grade in ascending order (Linq?). Initialize a list of 10 workers and sort them by money per hour in 
	descending order. Merge the lists and sort them by first name and last name
