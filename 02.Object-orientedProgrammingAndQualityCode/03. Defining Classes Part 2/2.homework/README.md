1. Organize your previous homework into separate files, namespaces and folders. Decouple your classes with the Console. 
	Fix all StyleCop errors that arise. 
2. Create a class Fraction with the properties/fields numerator, denominator, value 
	(string which will return for example “1/2”) and decimal value (e.g. “0.5”). 
	Perform the necessary validations when creating a new Fraction. Overload the operators “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”. 
	Test your application with different calculations.  
3. Create a class Matrix which corresponds to the mathematical definition of a matrix. 
	Overload the operators “+”, “-” and “*”. Check if those operations can be performed at all (validation). 
	Test all of your operations.
4. Create your own Generic List (called myList). Implement the following: Accessing by index, removing element by index, 
	inserting element at a given position, adding an element to the list, clearing the list, finding element by value and 
	ToString().
