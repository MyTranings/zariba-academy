1. Design an application which calculates the surface and perimeter of different shapes: circle, triangle, square, 
	rectangle, trapezium, rhombus and a regular n-gon. Make an abstract class Shape which will hold 2 methods 
	(calculate area and perimeter) and a single attribute value. Be very careful when using inheritance and 
	abstraction – all common features of each shape should be inherited from the base shape. If you can calculate the
	area using the sides only, you should do that. Otherwise, define all necessary additional fields you may 
	need like angles, heights and so on. Test your application with all possible shapes, stored in a list, and print 
	their area and perimeter.
